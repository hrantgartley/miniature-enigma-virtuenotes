**_Virtue Ethics_**

- Aristotle: 384-322 BCE
- Student of Plato
- Teacher of Alexander the Great
- Early philosopher and scientist

## Aristotle's goal: An objective, contextual ethics

- Black and white moral systems often cannot handle complex real-world issues

**What is the human good?**

- Aristotle: good -> purpose (noun)
- Something's good -> something's aim
- Individual actions have individual goods
- What is the good of human existence in general
- Figuring this out will tell us how to be "good"

**_The Human Good_**

- All human activity is directed towards happiness
- Happiness -> the human good
- What is happiness
- Greek notion: _eudaimonia_
  - state of _flourishing_
  - virtue: goodness of character->soundness of judgement, and that includes wise and sensible actions
- Ethics: pursuit of virtue and pursuing virtue allows us to achieve eudaimonia

**_Virtue_**

- Not associated with people but the actions they perform (process of habit)
- Every choice is a virtuous option and a lot of others
- We learn by doing
- How does one become brave?
  - doing virtuous actions
  - fake it 'til you make it

**_What makes an action virtuous_**

- There is no outline for this
- Relative to each situation
- Example: how much food should i eat?
  - Depends on context
- Virtue is a mean between the two extremes
  - An average b/t excess and defect
  - Example: too little or too much exercise
- Courage: we shouldn't be afraid of everything, but also not fearless -> find the right balance
- Honesty: we shouldn't lie all of the time but sometimes a lie might be the right choice (judgement)
- Charity: we shouldn't be selfish 100% of the time, but also not give away all of our money

**_How can I tell What is Virtuous_**

- The ultimate goal: behave virtuously out of habit, without having to think about it
- At the beginning, though, we canâ€™t do this. How do we know where to start?
- Look at a moral exemplar:
  - a role model who has better moral character than the average person
- You can determine who is a moral exemplar through a moral intuition
